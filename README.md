### Overview

For my final project of this course I have decided to build a Car Dealership E-Commerce site. I decided to build a car dealership site as the company I currently work for builds websites for Irish Car dealers and I felt this would be a good way to showcase the skills I have learned throughout the year at the code institute. Although purchasing a car outright is not something we would typically do online, I felt this would be a fun take on an e-commerce store and is easily customisable to fit a real world scenario. 


## Site User Goals
The main goals for users of my site would be to browse a wide range of cars for sale in the midlands so they can purchase a new car in their local area without having to travel too far to a bigger city. 
They would also be looking for flexible financing options and the ability to test drive the car so they can be sure they want to buy it and are happy with how it performs which in turn gives them peace of mind.
They also want to be able to simply browse vehicles without having to create an account but can also stay up to date by easily signing up to a newsletter informing them immediately when new stock is available


## Site Owner Goals
The main goals for the site owner are to provide an easy-to-navigate platform where users can browse a diverse range of cars for sale in the Midlands,just as they could in a bigger city.

They also want to be able to offer finance options to make their vehicles more accesible to a cariety of customers, which will help them sell more cars and in turn, generate a greater profit. Facilitating test drives of the cars also shows transparency and builds trust with their local community. 

The site owner also wants to make the site easy for staff to use with the integration of a product management section for superusers, so that staff members can upload new vehicles for sale easily with little room for user error. 

Finally, the site owner wants to keep generating traffic via the newsletter. If the newsletter is easy to sign up to, then users are likely to return when they are notified of new stock on site. 


### Brand Identity & Colour Palette

The brand identity of Mountmellick Motors is supposed to feel local, but professional. The colour scheme used is simple but also maintains a feel of professionalism that a user would expect from a car dealership. I included the Mountmellick crest as the favicon to really hammer home the feeling of a local business but maintain sleekness with the colour scheme used throughout the site and with the hero image. 


### Wireframes

I made a few basic wireframes on Balsamiq so I would have a rough idea of what I wanted the site to look like. Although I did not stick to them entirely, they did give me a good foundation to work with.

## Data Structure
I created a rough data structure on paper first so I would have an idea of how I wanted my models to relate to each other and this really helped me to keep things organised. I have also attempted to complete one online so you can visualise what I was aiming for:



# Agile Development

I did my best to follow the Agile development method by using Github User stories, issues, Kanban board, the Moscow system and milestones. This was a great help in terms of keeping me on track and being able to clearly visualize what work I had completed and what was left to do, as well as planning future implementations.
